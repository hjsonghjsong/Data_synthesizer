===What it is for===
Generate a UI element (label, button, calendar ticker, check box) manually ( at the point of a mouse click ) or automatically. 
It logs a mouse click event (time, position to the global screen) and screen caputres under the logs directory. 
Screen capture happens only when the mouse event happens. No worries to skip the intended frame with mouse events. 



===How to ===
pip install -r requirement.txt
python data_synthesizer.py
